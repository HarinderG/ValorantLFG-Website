{"name":"ValorantLFG","tagline":"","body":"### Introduction\r\nValorantLFG is a Discord bot that will help players find friends to play with. A group of 4 players that might need a Sage or Jet on their team would be able to use this Discord bot and specify what types of players they are in need of. They would be able to filter their results based on Rank, favorite agent, and play style using the match history data. After getting permission and linking their account using RSO (Riot Sign-On), players would be able to share their stats with other players in the network. This is valuable to players that are trying to find very specific players to queue with, or to those that are trying to build a competitive scrim team.\r\n\r\n### Data Types\r\n**RSO**: Players will authenticate and opt into making their profile public.\r\n * Users will be able to search and get more stats about other players in the network.\r\n\r\n**RiotID**: Users will be able to send friend requests once they’ve found a teammate.\r\n\r\n**Rank**: We need player ranks to sort and filter players currently looking for a game.\r\n\r\n**Location Data**: Using location data, we will be able to give a summary of how the player performs on a specific map.\r\n * Heat map of their preferred spot on the map. (B Site window, A Site, etc).\r\n\r\n**Match History Data**: We will need this data to give relevant facts about the player.\r\n * Most used gun (Operator, Vandal, Spectre, etc)\r\n * Average K/D based on maps.\r\n\r\n### Scaling\r\nWe will initially have a few users, but with our product being integrated with Discord, there is potential for it to grow due to the fact that the bot can be added to servers with an existing user base. At the start, we will be focused on providing good service to 10-20 users, and as we get feedback do our best to expand to hundreds in 3-5 months. We will also be implementing a caching system to avoid unnecessary API calls as ValorantLFG grows.\r\n\r\n### Value to players\r\nThere is a clear, heavy emphasis on team play and coordination within valorant.  We want to help the single queue players find other positive and team-oriented players to befriend and be competitive with. We think this product will help the community at all levels from Iron to Immortal, but will especially help the higher-ranked players (Platinum-Immortal) find well-suited teammates looking to coordinate character picks and climb ranks. We also see value in a team of 3 or 4 looking for extra team members to fill in gaps in roles.  For example, if there is a squad of 4 and they don’t have a reliable Sage player, they can use ValorantLFG to find a Sage to fill in and make their team whole.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDavid Shoemaker (@DavidShoeCS)\r\nHarinder Gakhal (@HarinderG)\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
